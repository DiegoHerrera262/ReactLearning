# Website for local laundry business
**Author:** Diego Alejandro Herrera Rojas

## Introduction

In this project I will consider a family laundry business that has services related to general clothes care: cleaning, ironing and reparing. Most of its services are performed by family members. Databases are tored in an unstructured manner, and data processing is carried out by a businesss administrator almost by hand. Sales depend upon regulars and perhaps an occasional passer-by.

The aim of this project is to start the process of creating an online store, by providing a a website for the business, that showcases the business services, as well as redirects users to the main channel of comunication with the store: a telephone landline. It is also desirable to increase the amount of regular clients for the store. In summary, the goals of the project are:

>1. Showcase the laundry as a thriving business using an attractive website layout.
>1. Display main services and prices in a clear manner that redirects to main channel of contact.
>1. Increase the number of regular clients by keeping in touch with them in the internet.

## Expected list of features

The webpage is expected to be highly interactive, with enough animations to make it look professional while keeping the information clearly readable. Given that the business is still small, the website should have the follogin features

>1. Clear presentation of the business model and all the aspects of the operation that create value for the final service
>1. A detailed list of the services, discounts and combos that the store presents. Also add a request price calculator.
>1. Emphasis on the main channels of contact: highlighting the actual physical location of the store and the telephone landline.
>1. Enable user registration so as to keep a detaild database of clients.
>1. A blog-like interface, linked to a newsletter, that allows keeping in contact with registerd users.

## Market survey

This project is related to the On-demand cleaning service. In the subspace of laundry,. I found the following similar references

>1. [FlyCleaners](http://flycleaners.com/)
>2. [Rinse](https://www.rinse.com/repeat/)
>3. [Cleanly](https://jungleworks.com/how-cleanly-works-insights-about-on-demand-laundry-business-application/)

These are based on USA, and are mostly smartphone apps. However, I believe I can learn from their interactivity and engaging nature. In Bogotá, Colombia, my immediate references are the sites:

>1. [Lavandería Lunatex](https://lunatex.com.co/)
>1. [Lava en Línea](https://somoslavaenlinea.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwy42FBhB2EiwAJY0yQrxiQIyu-0viOpQt4xzjLdfVFUUNDxAeMvK8u67S689xDm_dNeDkbBoC5CYQAvD_BwE)
>1. [La Bugalería](https://labugaderia.co/?gclid=CjwKCAjwy42FBhB2EiwAJY0yQoCpzi5yk72Iix8tNeTVvl1KGy5WoBJgacq9KjUmwp7Q3dX6reiZsBoCiGEQAvD_BwE)
>1. [https://mueblesbrillantes.com/landing-lavado-de-muebles/](https://mueblesbrillantes.com/landing-lavado-de-muebles/)

These unes are far less interactive, but have some of the key features that a family laundry business website shold have. In particular: 

>1. A request price calculator.
>1. A simple scheme of the business model and created value.
>1. Clear instructions for contact online and businesss physical location.
>1. User reviews.

My website can dramatically improve interactivity, and add the feature of a simple newsletter-like mobile device app that keeps in contact with registered clients.
