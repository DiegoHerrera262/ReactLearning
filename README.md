# Full-stack Web Development with React

This repo contains exercises, examples and notes on my learning process during the completion of the specialization program **Full-Stack Web Development with React**. This is given by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, for Coursera. The program consists of three courses:

1. Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap 4
1. Front-End Web Development with React
1. Server-side Development with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB

I separate each course on a directory. Each directory will contain a log, where all my thoughts and insights will be written, and subdirectories that contain each week's assignments.
